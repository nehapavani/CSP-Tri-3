# College Board Quizzes Corrections

### Finals Quiz 1
32. The correct answer was "Moving the statement in line 5 so that it appears between lines 2 and 3" because the iteration should be before the for loop for the function to work.
39. The correct answer was "80 seconds" since the most minimal time is X and Y run parallel first and then Z to get 80 seconds.
45. The correct answer is C: The cost of a given product is not tracked by the described search engine.

### Finals Quiz 2
1. D: Parallel computing solutions consist of a parallel portion and a sequential portion. When increasing the use of parallel computing in a solution, the efficiency of the solution is limited by the sequential portion. This means that at some point, adding parallel portions will no longer meaningfully increase efficiency.
14. A:  The two line graphs are roughly the same shape. Each value on the right line graph is about 10 times the corresponding value on the left line graph. Therefore, the average amount of data stored per user is about 10 GB.
35. C: Overflow errors occur when an arithmetic operation results in a value outside the range of numbers that can be represented by a fixed number of bits.
39. B: Different users may abbreviate city names differently. This may require the student to clean the data to make it uniform before it can be processed.

### Finals Quiz 3
1. B: If the connections between U and V and between U and P were removed, then computer T and computer U can no longer communicate.
2. D: An undecidable problem is one for which no algorithm can be constructed that is always capable of providing a correct yes-or-no answer. Some instances of an undecidable problem may have an algorithmic solution, but there is no algorithmic solution that could solve all instances of the problem.
7. D: The procedure initially sets result to 1 and j to 2. In the REPEAT UNTIL loop, result is first assigned the sum of result and j, or 1 + 2. The value of j is then increased to 3. In each subsequent iteration of the loop, result is increased by each successive value of j (3, 4, 5, etc.) until j exceeds n. Therefore, the procedure returns the sum of the integers from 1 to n.
13. C: If the number of units of electricity used is 25 or less, the cost is 5 times the number of units. Otherwise, the cost is 5 times the first 25 units plus 7 times the number of units above 25. For examples, if a customer used 32 units of electricity, they should be charged $5 for the first 25 and $7 for the additional 7 units (32 â€“ 25 = 7 units), for a total charge of $174. 
20. A: Binary 1011 is equivalent to 23+21+20, or decimal 11, and binary 1101 is equivalent to 23+22+20, or decimal 13. The order of the numbers (written in their equivalent decimal format) is 5, 11, 12, 13.
21. D: A strong password is something that is easy for a user to remember but would be difficult for someone else to guess based on knowledge of that user. Weak passwords can often be guessed based on publicly available information about a user. Other weak passwords (such as "password" or "1234") can often be guessed because they are commonly used.
23. D: The average number of characters per message appears to decrease after the mobile app was released.
28. C: From years 1 to 5, the number of registered users roughly doubled each year. From years 5 to 8, the number of registered users increased by about 100 million each year.
46. B: This is an example of symmetric encryption because the secret key is used for both encryption and decryption of messages.
48. B: It is not possible to use byte pair encoding in the string "LEVEL_UP" because no pair of characters appears in the string more than once.
