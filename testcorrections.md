# College Board Quizzes Corrections

### Finals Quiz 1
32. The correct answer was "Moving the statement in line 5 so that it appears between lines 2 and 3" because the iteration should be before the for loop for the function to work.
39. The correct answer was "80 seconds" since the most minimal time is X and Y run parallel first and then Z to get 80 seconds.
45. The correct answer is C: The cost of a given product is not tracked by the described search engine.

### Finals Quiz 2
1. D: Parallel computing solutions consist of a parallel portion and a sequential portion. When increasing the use of parallel computing in a solution, the efficiency of the solution is limited by the sequential portion. This means that at some point, adding parallel portions will no longer meaningfully increase efficiency.
14. A:  The two line graphs are roughly the same shape. Each value on the right line graph is about 10 times the corresponding value on the left line graph. Therefore, the average amount of data stored per user is about 10 GB.
35. C: Overflow errors occur when an arithmetic operation results in a value outside the range of numbers that can be represented by a fixed number of bits.
39. B: Different users may abbreviate city names differently. This may require the student to clean the data to make it uniform before it can be processed.
