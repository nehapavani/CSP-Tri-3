# College Board Quizzes Corrections

### Finals Quiz 1
32. The correct answer was "Moving the statement in line 5 so that it appears between lines 2 and 3" because the iteration should be before the for loop for the function to work.
39. The correct answer was "80 seconds" since the most minimal time is X and Y run parallel first and then Z to get 80 seconds.
45. The correct answer is C: The cost of a given product is not tracked by the described search engine.

1. D: Parallel computing solutions consist of a parallel portion and a sequential portion. When increasing the use of parallel computing in a solution, the efficiency of the solution is limited by the sequential portion. This means that at some point, adding parallel portions will no longer meaningfully increase efficiency.
14. A:  The two line graphs are roughly the same shape. Each value on the right line graph is about 10 times the corresponding value on the left line graph. Therefore, the average amount of data stored per user is about 10 GB.
35. C: Overflow errors occur when an arithmetic operation results in a value outside the range of numbers that can be represented by a fixed number of bits.
39. B: Different users may abbreviate city names differently. This may require the student to clean the data to make it uniform before it can be processed.

### Finals Quiz 3
1. B: If the connections between U and V and between U and P were removed, then computer T and computer U can no longer communicate.
2. D: An undecidable problem is one for which no algorithm can be constructed that is always capable of providing a correct yes-or-no answer. Some instances of an undecidable problem may have an algorithmic solution, but there is no algorithmic solution that could solve all instances of the problem.
7. D: The procedure initially sets result to 1 and j to 2. In the REPEAT UNTIL loop, result is first assigned the sum of result and j, or 1 + 2. The value of j is then increased to 3. In each subsequent iteration of the loop, result is increased by each successive value of j (3, 4, 5, etc.) until j exceeds n. Therefore, the procedure returns the sum of the integers from 1 to n.
13. C: If the number of units of electricity used is 25 or less, the cost is 5 times the number of units. Otherwise, the cost is 5 times the first 25 units plus 7 times the number of units above 25. For examples, if a customer used 32 units of electricity, they should be charged $5 for the first 25 and $7 for the additional 7 units (32 – 25 = 7 units), for a total charge of $174. 
20. A: Binary 1011 is equivalent to 23+21+20, or decimal 11, and binary 1101 is equivalent to 23+22+20, or decimal 13. The order of the numbers (written in their equivalent decimal format) is 5, 11, 12, 13.
21. D: A strong password is something that is easy for a user to remember but would be difficult for someone else to guess based on knowledge of that user. Weak passwords can often be guessed based on publicly available information about a user. Other weak passwords (such as "password" or "1234") can often be guessed because they are commonly used.
23. D: The average number of characters per message appears to decrease after the mobile app was released.
28. C: From years 1 to 5, the number of registered users roughly doubled each year. From years 5 to 8, the number of registered users increased by about 100 million each year.
46. B: This is an example of symmetric encryption because the secret key is used for both encryption and decryption of messages.
48. B: It is not possible to use byte pair encoding in the string "LEVEL_UP" because no pair of characters appears in the string more than once.

### Finals Quiz 4
4. C: The value of a Boolean variable is either “true” or “false.” These two possible values can be represented by the binary digits 0 or 1.
9. D: Takes a lot of time to complete
13. C: Program I correctly moves the robot to the gray square by repeatedly moving the robot forward, rotating left, moving forward, and rotating right. Program II correctly moves the robot to the gray square by moving the robot forward to the upper-right corner of the grid, rotating left, and moving forward to the upper-left corner of the grid.
16. A: Program A initializes i to 1. Inside the loop, it prints i and then increments i. The loop terminates when i is greater than 10, which occurs after 10 is printed. Program A prints 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10. Program B initializes i to 0. Inside the loop, it increments i and then prints i. The loop terminates when i equals 10, which occurs after 10 is printed. Program B prints 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10.
17. D: Version I calls the GetPrediction procedure once for each element of idList, or four times total. Since each call requires 1 minute of execution time, version I requires approximately 4 minutes to execute. Version II calls the GetPrediction procedure twice for each element of idList, and then again in the final display statement. This results in the procedure being called nine times, requiring approximately 9 minutes of execution time.
25. C: The code segment will iterate over myList from right to left, removing each element that is equal in value to the element immediately preceding it. This list does not contain any pairs of adjacent elements that are equal in value, so no elements will be removed even though the value 40 appears twice in the list.
29. C: It is possible to have redundant routing in both configurations. In configuration I, some possible routes between computers Q and V include Q-P-V, Q-T-V, and Q-R-S-V. In configuration II, some possible routes between computers Q and V include Q-S-V, Q-R-T-V, and Q-P-T-V.
30. D: The program traverses wordList starting at the end of the list and moving to the start of the list, removing any elements that are equal to "the" or "a" along the way. Inserting this statement between lines 7 and 8 decrements index after checking each list element, ensuring that all elements are checked.
32. A: With two processors running in parallel, execution time is minimized when the processors take on as close to an equal workload as possible. Running processes P and Q on one processor will take a total of 40 seconds. Running processes R and S on the other processor will take a total of 35 seconds. As the processors run in parallel, all four operations are completed in 40 seconds.
38. A: This code segment rotates right whenever there is an open square to the right. The robot will move forward from its initial location to the upper-left corner of the grid, then rotate right, then move forward to the upper-right corner of the grid, then rotate right, then move down two squares, then rotate right, then move forward to the gray square.
43. B: The Internet was designed to be scalable, using open protocols to easily connect additional computing devices to the network.
44. A: A rogue access point is a wireless access point that gives unauthorized access to secure networks. Data sent over public networks can be intercepted, analyzed, and modified. One way that this can happen is through a rogue access point.
45. C: Both code segments display the correct average. Code segment I requires more arithmetic operations because it performs the operation sum divided by LENGTH, open parenthesis, num List, close parenthesis within the loop, while code segment II performs the same operation only once.
