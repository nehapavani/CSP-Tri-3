1. Licenses: Creative Commons Zero v1.0 Universal, Open Source MIT License, Open Source GPL License
2. We chose the Open Source GPL License since it allows for work to be freely shared and modified and we want ore people to have access to our website since we are creating it for a business.

1. I have seen Personal Identifiable Information (PII) in the CSP nighthawkcodingsociety website which links to twitter, github, and other information
2. I am very safe on the internet and never give my PII to strangers, but I know that if you try and look you can find some of my personal information. But other than my name, birthday, and residence, I don’t think the internet has access to my PII.
3. Passwords
      * Good passwords are long with a mix of upper and lower case letters, numbers, and symbols.
      * Bad Passwords have ties to your personal information (family names, dog name, birthday) and dictionary words.
      * 2 Factor Authentication is extremely prevalent in our soctiety today. Emais, texts, and software-based authenticators like Google Authenticator are great ways to assist with authentication
4. Unlike symmetric encryption, which uses the same secret key to encrypt and decrypt sensitive information, asymmetric encryption, also known as public-key cryptography or public-key encryption, uses mathematically linked public- and private-key pairs to encrypt and decrypt senders’ and recipients’ sensitive data.
5. When deploying we initally used HTTP which did not have encryption. But then we used HTTPS which is HTTP with encryption. The difference between the two protocols is that HTTPS uses TLS (SSL) to encrypt normal HTTP requests and responses.
6. Deceptive phishing is the most common type of phishing scam. In this ploy, fraudsters impersonate a legitimate company to steal people’s personal data or login credentials. Those emails use threats and a sense of urgency to scare users into doing what the attackers want.
